<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
NPC's are a common addition in many video games yet they lack depth and inteligence. In this project, we aim to fix this using large language models to drive the conversations.

Here's why:
* Cheaper for game companies
* Easier and Faster to implement and populate world.
* Better user expierience

This is all achieved using OpenAI's API.
